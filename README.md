## Content Explanation
### its S.M.A.R.T goals

Provide players with the most comprehensive game for more people, so that players can buy their favorite games at a cheaper price. It also provides a place for players to try out the game.

* **Specific：** Gaining the recognition of many players, we have to have a full range of games and quality service, and have a price advantage.
* **Measurable** We hope to accumulate some user groups as soon as possible in the initial period, about 300-500 people in size, so that we can keep our store in an active state for a long time.
* **Achievable：** The initial center should be on publicity, because most of our user base is active in the online world, so we will put our ads on major video sites and promise to make some offers to attract customers.
* **Relevant:** We want our employees to love games, to have a certain level of knowledge about them, and to keep up to date with game-related information in order to provide a better user experience.
* **Time-bound** We hope to actively build up our clientele over the course of the year, and hopefully our store will be ranked among the top gaming stores in Singapore.
